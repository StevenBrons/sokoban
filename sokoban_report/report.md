# Sokoban
We made a Sokoban application for Android. We implemented this as a single player local puzzle game.

# Graphics
As an extra challenge we chose to make 3D graphics. We have clouds (most of the time...) moving on the back-/foreground. We made a special format file which contains information about the level. The game then takes this information and chooses the right sprites for the level. Such that for example fences and water tiles are connected the right way. We also have some tiles which are randomly chosen and thus vary per run of the level.

# Tiles 
We have different tiles, a short description of some of the tiles is given below:
	- Shepherd with dog: This is the player and can be moved around.
	- Sheep and shed: Every level has some sheep which can be pushed around. The purpose of the game is to push all the sheep in a shed.
	- Water: Sheep can only be pushed in or out water. (So not from one water tile to another.)

# Movement
You can choose to either use buttons for movement or swiping. This can be changed in the settings screen.

# Level selection
In the level selection screen you can choose the level you want to play. Every level shows a small preview. On the right of every level title (and author name) you can first see your best score and then the minimal score required for the level.

# Win screen
When you finish the level a win screen pops up. This shows the amount of steps you used to complete the level, your best score and the best score possible. From here you can go to the level selection, the next level or restart the last level.

# Landscape mode
The levels are forced in landscape mode so you can also play bigger levels without having to use a microscope.

# Music
We recorded and made our own music. The sheep sounds come from real sheep we recorded outside! The music consists of a small intro, a middle play which repeats itself and an outro. There is also sound for when you finish a level.

# Statistics
You can see the total amount of steps you made and as a bonus the total amount of calories you burned.

# Settings
As said previously you can change to either use buttons or swiping. You can also clear your data, mute the music and unlock a special feature when you made 1000 steps.

# Easter eggs
We have hidden three Easter eggs in the application. It is up to you to find these :).
